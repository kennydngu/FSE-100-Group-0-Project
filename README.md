# FSE-100-Group-0-Project
Repository for Group 0's weight scale gadget project

 
Our concept solution is a plate intended for bakers with limited vision or complete vision impairment. The plate will have numerous functions the primary one being measuring ingredients. The plate will have zeroing functions and other measures to ensure that accurate weights are recorded despite what container is used. Some secondary functions are that the plate will also have a circular “lid” of sorts that will come attached to the plate. Using this lid you put it over top of the container and it will read 2 things, the temperature and humidity of the contents inside. The plate will automatically read the weight of the object after 3 seconds of the change not being detected. This is so that it is not constantly providing output and ensures that when read the user is ready. The readings will be output via speaker where the weight followed by the temperature humidity will be called. We also want the plate to have a button input that allows the user to change the unit of measurement. (Also called by speaker)


Requirements
Functional
The plate must allow users to measure the weight of ingredients accurately, regardless of the container used.
The plate should allow for both liquid and solid ingredients to be measured with high accuracy.
The plate should provide audio or tactile feedback for users with limited or no vision to understand the readings
It should have a clear indication when the measurements are complete
The plate should also have clear tactile labels to aid with orientation and usage (e.g., raised buttons or textures for different functions).
Nonfunctional 
The plate must be safe to use around hot surfaces or containers with insulated parts to prevent burns or injuries.
All materials used should be food-safe and non-toxic.
The plate must be durable and resistant to damage from daily kitchen use (e.g., drops, spills).
The material should be heat and water-resistant, ensuring it can withstand the environment of a kitchen.
The plate should be simple to use, especially for users who are blind or have limited vision. Controls should be tactile, and feedback should be clear and intuitive.
The plate should have a straightforward user interface with minimal complexity.
The plate should be easy to clean and maintain, with smooth, non-porous surfaces that resist the accumulation of ingredients and moisture.
Constraints
The plate's size must be practical for common kitchen use, balancing the need for large measurement areas with ease of storage.
The sensors for temperature and humidity may have accuracy limits based on the physical environment or limitations in technology, and must be calibrated to account for such variations.
