Use Cases 

Intended for Blind Bakers
Measuring liquids that need to be hot or cold. It is not only unsanitary but also unsafe to touch liquids that have unknown temperature, our plate solves this by allowing bakers to properly measure the temperature and weight of liquids however the recipe calls.
Measuring flour to test the shelf life. Our plate also includes a humidity feature that allows you to test the usability of numerous dry ingredients such as yeast, flour, sugar, salt, etc. If there is humidity in any of these ingredients it could be detrimental to the quality of the outcome. 
Our product has to be used in cases where the ingredient used are already known. If the ingredients are not already properly labeled for vision impaired, our device cannot help as it is not able to accurately determine the ingredient in which it is measuring. 
Other use cases
Our device helps with everyday functions. A cup of tea, bowl of noodles, or even plain simple water, all can be weighed and its temperature can be read. It will help blind people enjoy just everyday things without the risk of burning themselves to check if water is hot enough to say cook noodles, and it also ensures precise measurements so those same noodles don’t come in a watery soup.
Storage can also be monitored to ensure food doesn’t go bad. By simply just putting our lid on a closed container it will read the humidity for you to ensure that these closed containers are remaining dry so that the contents inside do not spoil.
